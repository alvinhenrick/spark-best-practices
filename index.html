				#### What did we learn and you need to know ?

				- Always run on less no of nodes . It will tell us the failures early and give better distribution of load causing less network i/o for shuffles
				- Caching a view that is going to be used multiple time is helpful. For **smaller** table <span style="color:blue">**broadcast**</span>, for slight larger table cache.
				- Always run UDF on smaller views. Pass only the <span style="color:blue">**needed**</span> columns and zip it back.
                - `saveAsTable` default implementation creates no. of partitions **multiply** no . of buckets files.
				- Hence a force repartition is necessary to mitigate the difference in hive bucketing vs spark bucketing.
				- `df.repartition()` followed by `saveAsTable` runs in multiple stages and causes lot of errors during execution.

				#### Use SQL API to bucket

				```
				CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS claims
				USING PARQUET
				CLUSTERED BY claimuid,memberuid
				SORTED BY claimuid,memberuid INTO 800 BUCKETS
				LOCATION '{target_path}' AS
				SELECT * from claims_raw DISTRIBUTE BY claimuid, memberuid
				```

				#### Checkpoints : Why do we need them ?

				- To deal with spark <span style="color:red">**long lineage**</span> graph.
				- Checkpoint and reload you have to start your <span style="color:red">**thinking**</span> back from how the pipeline started.
				- Initially we started pipeline with bucketed or partitioned data and in the middle we checkpoint that <span
                    style="color:red">**erases**</span> information and cause lot of trouble during downstream feature engineering stages.

				#### UDF : The invocation is non deterministic ?

				- <span style="color:blue">**Unit**</span> test will have no problem.
				- <span style="color:blue">**Sample**</span> will have no problem.
				- <span style="color:blue">**Terabyte** and **Billions** records</span>. Yes will have lots of problems.

				#### UDF : How do we fix it ?

				- We did  <span style="color:red">**eager execution**</span> via caching or checkpoint to deal with it.
				- How to identify ? Read the graph or explain plan.
				- Lets see the demo in the **end**.

				#### Windowing and Group By

                - If window functions can be avoided by using group by.
				- It should be avoided for larger views as to implement this window functions spark will reshuffle the data even if its partitioned because
it is not aware of data until it evaluates.
				- Its better to cache before applying such operation. <span style="color:blue">**if and only if**</span>
				- They are complex and doing a lot of operations and aggregations.
				- Experience, learn and apply.

				#### My Opinion and thanks for listening.

				- Its not over we have just started.
				- Big Data is not Fast Data
				- Remember the [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)
